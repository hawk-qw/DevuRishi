                    Hii my love,
                    We have completed six months together. This is my way of celebrating our togetherness. I am so happy and feel lucky to have you.

                    I feel unworthy of the love you have given me, and I will always be indebted to you, my queen. I just want you to be happy. You have made me a better person, and I find myself so relieved around you. Your laughter at my bad jokes, our "galeechtaa", or when I roast someone, all make me happy.

                    Although I may not be the best boyfriend, I strive to become better every day. But guess what? I have the best girlfriend ever. I know we have our bad days, but they haven't changed anything between us.

                    I love hearing "I love you" after a fight and how it brings us closer. Cheers to the six months that have passed, and I will relive those days in my mind whenever I am not with you, especially when you are busy.

                    Here's to many more months to come!.!!!!!!!!
                    U said maybe there is some complication in our future,
                    Babyy be rest assured JAB TAK MAI HOON TUMHE CHINTA NHI KARNI, I'll make it work in the end.
                </p>
